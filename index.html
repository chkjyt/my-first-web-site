  <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C_%EC%99%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C_%EC%9B%B9" target="_blank" title="html5 specipication">
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system[1] accessed over the Internet.[2] It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.[3]</p>

  <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>

  <p>Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[4] Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components, which are either displayed or internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.</p>
